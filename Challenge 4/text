Challenge 4 Debug Log
reversed kickforce direction so enemies fly away from player when hit
switched findObjectsWithTag statement to find "PowerUp" tag, rather than "Enemy" so it counts enemies rather than powerups
added line to start powerup cooldown coroutine inside ontriggerenter statement to create powerUp cooldown system
switched the 2 to waveCount in spawnEnemyWave for statement to make enemy spawn increase
increased the enemy speed to 500 and added refference to playerGoal
created if statement which changes speed from default speed to boost speed when the player holds the spacebar
